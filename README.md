# Heroes Of Pymoli

Fictional purchasing reports from a fictional fantasy video game. The reports were generated using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Jupyter Notebook. Each report can be viewed by either scrolling below, downloading and running the HeroesOfPymoli.py script (with accompanying resources i.e. this repo) or by opening the jupyter notebook @ https://github.com/theodoremoreland/HeroesOfPymoli/blob/master/notebooks/HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb
