# Heroes Of Pymoli

Fictional purchasing reports from a fictional fantasy video game. The reports were generated using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Jupyter Notebook. Each report can be viewed by either scrolling below, downloading and running the HeroesOfPymoli.py script (with accompanying resources i.e. this repo) or by opening the jupyter notebook @ https://github.com/theodoremoreland/HeroesOfPymoli/blob/master/notebooks/HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb

# Results

## Takeaways
* Items priced less than 3.00 dollars are significantly less likley to sell than more expensive items. The sellers might be excellent in estimating the value of their items or perhaps the game itself exploits psychological mechanics to entice players to spend more money. Interesting, nonetheless.

* The highest spenders (on average) are in the age range 35-39 with an average player spending 4.76 dollars, followed by players younger than 10 years old with players spending an average of 4.53 dollars. Perhaps there is a correlation between families with members in each group and average spending per family member.

* There are more purchases than members for each age group. The age range 20-24 has the highest purchase to player ratio with the total number of purchases being 141 per/100 of the player count. The second highest being players within the range 30-34 with 140 per/100. These two age groups might be the most susceptible to prior marketing and psychological techniques, or they have stronger relationships to the game.
